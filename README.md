#### Information Technology
I think “passion” is, maybe, the more correct word than the “interested”. I touched the first PC softly at 9 or 10, and I’ve called it “magic” since then. Before that moment, all possible-things in my mind - as I remembered - are electricity, colors televisions, cassette players, school stuffs like notebooks (a notebook is actually a notebook rather than a notebook, I know you know lol), pencils, marbles, balls, insects, uhm... and my teachers maybe.

And everything have changed since that stage. It is likely the “I’m falling in love” phenomena. I’m really interested in computer. It has risen my curiousity and I want to know how it work, and how to make it be useful.
#### Design
